=((I13+1)*(I12+1)*(I11+1)*(I10+1)*(I9+1)*(I8+1)*(I7+1)*(I6+1)*(I5+1)*(I4+1)*(I3+1)*(I2+1))-1

o	For the first sample (Testing period) :
	I will change the weight for the portfolios invested between 01/10/2001 and 01/03/2003
	I will change the weight for the portfolios invested between 01/10/2008 and 01/03/2010
o	For the second sample (Implementation period): 
	I will change the weight for the portfolios invested between 01/04/2020 until the end of my sample


Results for classifical and modified weights:
    holding period x2
    yearly x2
